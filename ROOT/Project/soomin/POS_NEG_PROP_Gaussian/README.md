This directory is for those none zero Positive & Negative proportion distribution to smear into Gaussian function.

1. "cd N1_FILE_MAKER" and then, "python FILE_MAKER.py"  with correctly set input text files. Output files would be locates at "output_files"
2. "cd N2_execute_root" and then, "python 1_execute_test.py" with reasonably set files from "output_files"  (PyROOT required). You will have Gaussian fitted histogram plot under same directory.
